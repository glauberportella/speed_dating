My name is Mohit. I am using python 3 for my code. The core logic is developed with help from nice python libraries i.e. pandas and numpy. I use matplotlib for plotting graphs.The preprocessing code is stored in preprocess.py. The graph plotting for question 2 is in 2_1.py and 2_2.py. The code for conversion of continuous valued columns to discrete values is written in discretize.py. The split.py file has logic for splitting the data stored in data-binned.csv file to training and testing dataset in 80-20 ratio.

Finally, the naive bayes classifier algorithm is written in 5_1.py file. The main logic is in function named nbc(t_frac). In 5_2.py and 5_3.py, there is code for plotting graphs for variation of number of bins with accuracy and fraction of training data with accuracy respectively.

The detailed report can be found in CS573_HW2.pdf.

Happy Coding!
